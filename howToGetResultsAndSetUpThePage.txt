Manually copy paste the results to the spreadsheet (in open office use ctrl+shift+v for paste special to get actual times and not the dayTime format) 
after that save file in the /data/results_in_CSV/{eventNumber}_rbgp_{year}csv_results.csv. 
then in the script parseResultsFromCSV.py change the csv filename and then ran the script. 
Now create the new folder in the data folder with the name of the year 
and in it create a json file with the name of the year as 2024.json paste the data which we parse in this file.
Then in veterans.js file search for the following lines and properly comented out the right one...         

        // if we have the results for current year use lines with currentYear
        // if we don'ts have the results for current year yet use lines with currentYear -1
        `*** Did ${compData.displayName} finished all RBGP editions from 2015 to ${currentYear} with a total time of ${totalTime} ?` :
        `${compData.displayName} finished all RBGP editions from 2015 to ${currentYear} with a total time of ${totalTime}`;
        // `*** Did ${compData.displayName} finished all RBGP editions from 2015 to ${currentYear -1} with a total time of ${totalTime} ?` :
        // `${compData.displayName} finished all RBGP editions from 2015 to ${currentYear -1} with a total time of ${totalTime}`;
