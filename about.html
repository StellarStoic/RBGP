        <h2 class="aboutTitles">The History of the Pony Bike</h2>
        <p>The story of the Pony bike began in 1871 when businessman Ivan Janesh bought a piece of land along Trubarjeva Street and built a small ground-floor building for leather tanning. Over the years, the production building grew, and in 1938, the factory was taken over by Mergenthaller, the owner of a tannery in Vrhnika.</p>
        <p>After World War II, the factory, known as Indus, was nationalized. It was soon decided that instead of processing leather, bicycles would be produced in the factory. Thus, in 1951, the factory's transformation began, and two years later, the first Rog bikes rolled off the production lines.</p>
        <p>The first Pony bikes, as we know them today, began production in 1965. They were considered the first foldable bikes in Slovenia (the first foldable bikes were actually made in 1895 for military use; the bikes could be folded and carried on the back).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the Pony bikes were not the work of local constructors, but were essentially copies of Italian "graziella" bikes, which were produced in the Pistoia region of Tuscany. Therefore, Slovenian workers went to Italy to learn about the production process. At that time, similar "U" bikes were being produced in many other European countries, but with various modifications.</p>
        <p>The Pony bikes were not only the first foldable bikes in Slovenia, but they were also the first bikes without the famous "bar". They were quickly accepted by the people. Many grew up with them, and they were also a popular gift for good school report cards and confirmations. The bike was extremely functional, suitable for people of all sizes and ages, and maintenance and repair were easy.</p>
        <p>One of the major flaws was the fold in the middle, which could cause the bike to break into two parts under too much strain and improper use. However, Pony bikes were not only produced in the Ljubljana factory. The political leadership decided to move part of the production to Sarajevo. In the local production plants, known as Pretis, they began to produce "Bosnian ponies".</p>
        <p>The Pony bike was not only popular in Slovenia but was also exported to many countries, including Iran, the United States, and Canada. Its compact and foldable design made it particularly popular among yacht and sailboat owners. For foreign markets, Rog manufactured various, more modern versions of Pony bikes, including models with gears and front and rear suspension. Over the years, the Pony bikes were continuously improved. In addition to the standard Pony bikes, which had 20-inch wheels, larger "maxi ponies" with 24-inch wheels were also produced.</p>
        <p>With the end of Yugoslavia came the inevitable end of the Rog factory and the production of Pony bikes. In 1991, the factory management decided to abandon production at the Trubarjeva plant due to high logistical costs and consolidate all production activities in the industrial zone along Letališka Street. Like many other Slovenian companies, Rog followed a similar story marked by the cessation of production, bankruptcy, and layoffs. The 7,000 square meter factory is now a space for cultural activities.</p>
        <p>Despite the end of production almost two decades ago, the time has not yet driven the Pony bikes off the streets. They are ridden by both schoolchildren and gentlemen in suits, and their distinctive sign is also the sound of "squeaking" chains and, of course, bells. Many Pony bikes, which were once produced in various colors, have undergone multiple repaintings, and in case of frame damage, many were simply welded at home.</p>
        <p>If any bikes regularly change owners, they are definitely the Pony bikes, which is why more careful owners equip them with chains, which are often strong enough to pull spruce logs.</p>

        <h2 class="aboutTitles">The Evolution and Variations of the Pony Bike</h2>
        <p>Over the years, the Pony bike underwent continuous improvements, with each new model bringing its own unique features and enhancements. The evolution of the Pony bike can be traced through its various models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>P1</strong>: (~ 1972 - 1981) This model featured a luggage rack that was part of the frame. This design element was a practical feature that added to the bike's utility, allowing riders to carry items with them on their journeys.</li>
            <li><strong>P2</strong>: (~ 1981 to 1983) The P2 model introduced a "Slovenian" luggage rack. This was a modification from the original design, demonstrating the adaptability and innovation that characterized the Pony bike's development.</li>
            <li><strong>P3</strong>: (~ 1983 to 1985) The P3 model brought updates to the brakes and the folding mechanism. These improvements made the bike safer and easier to use, enhancing its appeal to a wide range of users.</li>
            <li><strong>P4</strong>: (~ 1985 to 1987) This was the last generation of the foldable Pony bike. Despite being the final iteration of the original design, the P4 model continued to uphold the Pony bike's reputation for practicality and convenience.</li>
            <li><strong>P5</strong>: (~ 1987 to 1991) The P5 model was a departure from previous designs, featuring a non-folding design. This model represented a significant shift in the Pony bike's evolution, demonstrating the ongoing innovation that characterized its development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the standard Pony bikes, which had 20-inch wheels, Rog also once produced larger models, known as "Maxi Pony," which featured larger, 24-inch wheels. However, many enthusiasts consider the true Pony bikes to be those with the smaller wheels. This preference underscores the Pony bike's reputation for compactness and convenience, qualities that have endeared it to generations of riders.</p>
        <p>Each of these models played a part in the Pony bike's enduring popularity, offering users a range of options to suit their individual needs and preferences. Despite the end of its production, the Pony bike's legacy lives on. Its various models serve as a testament to its adaptability, practicality, and the fond memories it evokes in those who grew up with it.</p>
        <p>However, the legacy of the Pony bike was far from over. The Rog brand and the iconic Pony bike have been resurrected by the company Turna d.o.o. With a refreshed logo, Turna d.o.o. is breathing new life into the Pony bike. They are developing new bikes, including an aluminum foldable city bike with internal gears, modeled after the original Pony. This revival is a testament to the Pony bike's enduring appeal and its continued relevance in today's urban landscapes. The Pony bike is back, ready to create new memories for a new generation of riders.</p>

        <h2 class="aboutTitles">Pony is back!</h2>
        <p>The Pony bike, a symbol of Slovenian cycling history, has been revived by the company Turna d.o.o., breathing new life into this iconic bike. The Pony bike is more than just a means of transport - it's a piece of Slovenian history that continues to inspire and bring people together.</p>
        <p>In 2015, the inaugural Red Bull Goni Pony race was held, marking a significant event in the history of the Pony bike. This race is a cycling hill climb that unites two legends of Slovenian cycling – the Vršič pass and the Pony bike. The course length is 13.5 km with an elevation gain of 801 m.</p>
        <p>The Red Bull Goni Pony race has specific rules and regulations to maintain the spirit of the original Pony bike. Only riders with "Pony like" bikes can enter the competition, with the most appreciated being Rog's legendary model produced from the '60s to the '80s. Riders with new Pony bikes manufactured in 2017 are also welcome, but only the gearless “Pony Classic” model meets the technical requirements. The bikes must have 20-inch wheels, no gears, no motors, and at least a functioning rear brake. No carbon parts are allowed, and there are specific restrictions on gear ratio, crank length, and pedal type.</p>
        <p>Despite the technological limitations of the Pony bikes, the passion and tireless energy of the riders make the race an exciting and inspiring event. The current best time for the race is 00:39:39, a record set by Luka Kovačič in 2020. If you look at the overall results, it's no surprise to see that Kovačič holds the three best times - the man is tireless. For comparison, the record for the "Juriš na Vršič", a road bike competition, stands at a time of 32:27, set by serial winner Gregor Tekavec in the 29th edition of the race in 2007. This comparison highlights the unique challenges of the Red Bull Goni Pony race, where participants tackle a similar uphill climb not on modern road bikes, but on the classic, gearless Pony bikes. </p>
        <p>However, the Red Bull Goni Pony race is not just a competition for the strongest men and women. It's also a fun event with a vintage note, a celebration of the enduring appeal of the Pony bike. Participants come with different goals, some aiming to beat the climb in under 2 hours, others simply looking to enjoy the ride and the camaraderie. The race lasts 2 hours, after which the most fun and dangerous part begins - the descent.</p>
        <p>The Red Bull Goni Pony race is a testament to the spirit of the Pony bike. It embodies movement, socializing, and the sense of freedom and independence that children first experience when they set out on a journey around the block. This event is about creating memories and celebrating a significant piece of Slovenian history. More than just a race, the Red Bull Goni Pony is a celebration of the Pony bike's enduring legacy. It offers a chance to relive the past and an opportunity to forge new memories and friendships. It's a unique blend of competition, camaraderie, and nostalgia, all set against the backdrop of Slovenia's beautiful landscapes.</p>
